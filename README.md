# 🧱 Vantara OS – OS for all

**Vantara OS** is a project to build an open source operating system from the ground up – lightweight, modular, and free from outside corporate influence. It is built specifically for local environments, education, and users who want full control over their devices.

> **Status**: Pra-Alpha | Code in active development

## 🎯 Vision

Creating an independent operating system that is:
- Built from the ground up (not just a distro)
- Adapted to local needs (language, culture, security)
- Serves as a platform for education and digital freedom
- Open, transparent, and community-supported

---

## 🚀 Why this project is important?

Today, most of our systems rely on external technology – we are just users. 
This project is an effort to build from the ground up: an OS that we understand, we control, and we design ourselves.
